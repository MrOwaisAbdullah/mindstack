"""Guardrail: the code default and `.env.example` must not drift apart.

`.env.example` is what an operator copies. The pydantic default in
`config/settings/env.py` is what they get when they *don't* — a fresh
`docker compose up` with no `.env` at all, which is exactly the path the
getting-started docs walk. Those two are the same promise made twice, and
nothing was checking they said the same thing.

They didn't. `.env.example` said `ADMIN_PANEL_URL_PATH=ops/`; the code
default said `admin/`. Every doc, every `or "ops/"` fallback in the code,
`templates/ops/` and the nav tests said `ops`. So a lab instance brought
up without a `.env` served its ops UI from `/admin/` — 200 there, 404 at
the `/ops/` every document named — and the `/setup` wizard's Finish
button cheerfully landed on a URL no page mentioned.

The divergence is only visible when you boot without a `.env`, which is
the one configuration nobody develops against and every newcomer uses.
